- Created `euf-viper` as a Rust package.
- Verified WMI cluster reachability and queue state before designing cluster
  scripts.
- Checked LTS and WMI default shells for Rust, Z3, and CAS tools.
- Read current web sources for SMT-LIB QF_UF, SMT-LIB benchmarks, SMT-COMP
  tooling, LLM2SMT, and congruence-closure proof literature.
- Implemented the first EUF verifier milestone:
  - SMT-LIB S-expression tokenizer/parser.
  - Declarations and assertions.
  - `and`, `not`, equality, `distinct`, and `let`.
  - Hash-consed term arena.
  - Union-find and congruence closure over function applications.
  - CLI commands: `solve`, `stats`, `gen`, and `bench`.
  - Unit tests for direct contradictions, congruence, lets, generated chains,
    and unsupported disjunctions.
- Installed Z3 4.16.0 locally and ran comparator canaries.
- Added a safe common-consequence preprocessor for positive `or`; it can prove
  equational-diamond contradictions but still reports unsupported when no
  contradiction follows.
- Recorded local canary results under
  `research-vault/06-results/2026-07-08-local-canary.md`.
- Built the Jupyter Book HTML successfully.
- Ran local SageMath, Singular, and Julia/Oscar-style quotient sanity artifacts;
  Magma was skipped because it was not on the local PATH.
- Found Magma on LTS at `/opt/magma/V2.28-3/magma` and ran the Magma artifact
  remotely with `-n` to bypass quota-broken startup logging.
- Submitted WMI job `139145`; it completed successfully and produced the first
  cluster synthetic benchmark log.
- Continued improving against Z3:
  - made positive `or` preprocessing branch-aware;
  - added all-branch pruning against surrounding disequalities;
  - added `diamond`, `pruned-or`, and `bench-or` generators;
  - added repeated median Z3 comparator;
  - measured 18.8x to 64.4x local median speedups on diamond canaries;
  - submitted WMI job `139146`, which completed the OR bench successfully.
